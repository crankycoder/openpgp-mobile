# Claude Development Guidelines

## üèóÔ∏è Repository Structure - Three Distinct Subprojects

This repository contains **three separate subprojects** that should be clearly distinguished in all documentation:

## ü§ñ AUTO-BOOTSTRAP ON STARTUP

When Claude Code starts a new session, automatically:

1. Bootstrap all LLM prompts using `mcp__llm-prompts__startLlmPrompts`
2. Review the bootstrapped prompts for:
   - Code change planning instructions
   - Task completion instructions
   - Git commit standards
   - Git workflow best practices
   - LLM testing guidelines
   - MCP tool setup guidelines

This ensures all best practices are loaded without manual intervention.

# üö® CRITICAL: TOOL PRIORITY ORDER üö®

## üöÄ Git Operations Priority

### For Git-Related Commands:

1. **FIRST TRY**: 1. Desktop Commander (`mcp__desktop-commander__execute_command`)

| Git Operation         | Priority 1: Desktop Commander |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Create feature branch | `git checkout -b` via DC      |
| Create/Update PR      | `gh pr create` via DC         |
| Check PR status       | `gh pr checks` via DC         |
| Mark PR ready         | `gh pr ready` via DC          |
| Sync with upstream    | `git pull --rebase` via DC    |
| Complete feature      | Manual cleanup via DC         |

### For All Other Operations:

## ‚ö° NEVER use the standard Read/Write/Bash tools ‚ö°

## ‚ö° ALWAYS use Desktop Commander MCP equivalents ‚ö°

| ‚ùå NEVER USE | ‚úÖ ALWAYS USE                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Read         | `mcp__desktop-commander__read_file`           |
| Write        | `mcp__desktop-commander__write_file`          |
| Edit         | `mcp__desktop-commander__edit_block`          |
| **Bash**     | **`mcp__desktop-commander__execute_command`** |
| LS           | `mcp__desktop-commander__list_directory`      |
| Grep         | `mcp__desktop-commander__search_code`         |
| Glob         | `mcp__desktop-commander__search_files`        |

### üî¥ For non-git commands use Desktop Commander:

- `poetry run pytest` ‚Üí Use Desktop Commander
- `npm install`, `yarn test` ‚Üí Use Desktop Commander
- File operations ‚Üí Use Desktop Commander
- ANY non-git shell command ‚Üí Use Desktop Commander

**TOOL PRIORITY: Desktop Commander ‚Üí NEVER standard tools**

---

## üìù Prompt Journal Format

### Feature-Based Documentation Requirements

Document all development activity in feature-specific journals:

| Requirement  | Details                                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Location** | `./docs/CLAUDE_WORKSPACE/journal/features/<branch-name>.md`     |
| **Creation** | Automatically created on first commit to feature branch         |
| **Content**  | Document all prompts, responses, and decisions for that feature |
| **Archival** | Move to `archive/YYYY-MM/` when feature merges to dev           |

### Directory Structure

```
docs/CLAUDE_WORKSPACE/journal/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/           # Active feature journals
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user-auth.md   # One file per active feature
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api-v2.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/           # Completed features
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025-06/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ payment-integration.md
```

### Journal Contents

Each feature journal should include:

- **Feature Overview** - What the feature accomplishes
- **User Prompts** - All prompts related to this feature
- **Implementation Details** - Key decisions and approaches
- **Errors & Resolutions** - Problems encountered and solutions
- **Lessons Learned** - Insights for future development

## üîß Development Practices

### Core Requirements

- ‚úÖ Always remember to use the prompt journal format above
- ‚úÖ Run tests locally before creating PRs
- ‚úÖ Keep PRs small and focused (one model/feature at a time)
- ‚úÖ Follow the git workflow: `feature branch ‚Üí dev ‚Üí main`
- ‚úÖ Document decisions and rationale in the journal
- ‚úÖ When asked to review/update plans, check for architectural changes
- ‚úÖ Create design documents when implementation diverges from plan

### Tool Usage

- üñ•Ô∏è **DESKTOP COMMANDER MCP IS MANDATORY** for ALL file and command operations
- üåê **ALWAYS USE browsermcp** for web operations (browser navigation, clicking, typing)
- üîç **ALWAYS USE mcp**sequentialthinking\*\*\*\* for complex problem solving and multi-step reasoning
- üìù Use **TodoWrite** tool to track task progress
- üß† Use **mcp**memory\*\*\*\* tools for knowledge management

**REMINDER: The standard Bash/Read/Write/Edit tools are FORBIDDEN. Only Desktop Commander.**

### Git Commit Standards

## üî¥ COMMIT FREQUENCY RULES - CRITICAL üî¥

**COMMIT IMMEDIATELY WHEN:**

1. ‚úÖ Any test goes from failing to passing
2. ‚úÖ A new test is written and passes
3. ‚úÖ A feature/function is implemented and its test passes
4. ‚úÖ Any significant code change that moves toward the goal
5. ‚úÖ **After creating new files** - Commit directory structure and initial files
6. ‚úÖ **After each logical unit of work** - Even if tests aren't written yet

**DO NOT:**

- ‚ùå Wait until everything is done to commit
- ‚ùå Bundle multiple features in one commit
- ‚ùå Skip commits because "it's not finished yet"

**EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:**

```
1. Write test ‚Üí Run test (fails) ‚Üí Implement code ‚Üí Test passes ‚Üí COMMIT
2. Add another test ‚Üí Test passes ‚Üí COMMIT
3. Refactor code ‚Üí Tests still pass ‚Üí COMMIT
4. Fix lint issue ‚Üí COMMIT
```

**COMMIT MESSAGE REQUIREMENTS:**

- Commit messages MUST describe:
  - What new tests were added
  - Any tests that were deleted
- Always ensure lefthook precommit hooks are setup and installed
- **Every time tests are run, commit code so we have history**
- **Every commit should update the top level PR message if a PR has been created for the current branch**

### Testing Requirements

Run coverage analysis locally:

```bash
poetry run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
```

## üìä Coverage Analysis

### Running Coverage Reports

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html

# View HTML report
open htmlcov/index.html
```

### Coverage Standards

- **Target**: >80% coverage on all new code
- **Reports**: Check both terminal and HTML outputs
- **Enforcement**: Verify before creating PRs

## üìã Pull Request Standards

### PR Description Template

**ALWAYS** use the standardized PR template when creating or updating PRs:

- **Template location**: `/docs/CLAUDE_WORKSPACE/pr-template.md`
- **Required sections**: Summary, Test Results, Test Changes, Changes
- **Auto-include**: Test statistics and coverage data
- **See also**: `/docs/CLAUDE_WORKSPACE/workflow-optimization-strategies/pr-template-compliance.md`

### Creating PRs with Template

```bash
# Use the template for PR body
gh pr create --title "feat: description" --body-file /docs/CLAUDE_WORKSPACE/pr-template.md
```

## üöÄ Quick Reference

| Command                       | Purpose                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `uv run pytest --cov=src`     | Run tests with coverage       |
| `open htmlcov/index.html`     | View detailed coverage report |
| `git checkout -b feature/...` | Create feature branch         |
| `uv run pytest`               | Run tests without coverage    |
| `gh pr edit --body "..."`     | Update PR description         |

## üìå Important Reminders

1. **Desktop Commander MCP is mandatory** for file and process operations
2. **Document everything** in the daily prompt journal
3. **Test before PR** - always run coverage analysis
4. **Small PRs win** - one feature at a time
5. **Commit messages matter** - describe test changes clearly
6. **Commit after every test run** - maintain complete history
7. **Update PR descriptions** - keep them current with each commit
8. **Use worktrees for parallel work** - never work directly on dev/main
9. **Check for duplicate files** - ensure no duplicate models/tests from copy-paste
10. **Always update prompt journal** - at end of each session
11. Always use the Makefile to build flatbuffer C bindings using: `make flatbuffer_c`

## üõ°Ô∏è Protected Files Policy

### Files You Must NEVER Edit

The following files are **READ-ONLY** during normal development:

| Protected File/Pattern                     | Reason                                    |
| ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `/docs/CLAUDE_WORKSPACE/plan.md`           | High-level project plan, human-controlled |
| `/docs/CLAUDE_WORKSPACE/architecture/*.md` | Technical designs, require review         |
| `/docs/book/**/*.md`                       | Published documentation                   |
| `/plan.md`                                 | Legacy plan location                      |
| `/README.md`                               | Project documentation                     |
| `/CONTRIBUTORS.md`                         | Contributor list                          |

### Files You May Edit

| File                                                  | Allowed Changes                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/docs/CLAUDE_WORKSPACE/tasks.md`                     | ‚úÖ Check off completed tasks<br>~~Strike through~~ descoped items<br>Add PR numbers |
| `/docs/CLAUDE_WORKSPACE/journal/features/<branch>.md` | Add prompts, responses, decisions                                                   |
| Source code files                                     | Full editing as needed                                                              |

### If You Accidentally Modify Protected Files

1. **STOP** - Do not commit
2. **Revert** - Use `git checkout -- <file>` to undo changes
3. **Document** - Note the incident in your feature journal
4. **Alert** - Tell the user before proceeding

### Branch Protection Rules

- **NEVER** commit directly to `main` or `dev` branches
- **ALWAYS** work on feature branches (`feature/*`, `fix/*`, etc.)
- Branch protection is enforced by lefthook pre-commit hooks

## ü§ñ Automatic Behaviors

These actions should be performed automatically without waiting to be asked:

1. **After creating branch**: Push immediately with `git push -u origin branch-name`
2. **After pushing new branch**: Create draft PR with `gh pr create --draft --body-file /docs/CLAUDE_WORKSPACE/pr-template.md`
3. **After every commit**: Push automatically with `git push`
4. **After creating/updating PR**: Monitor CI every 30 seconds until all checks pass
5. **When all CI checks pass**: Mark draft PR as ready with `gh pr ready`
6. **When PR is merged**: Perform complete branch cleanup
7. **When starting new feature**: Create feature journal in `journal/features/`
8. **When tests fail**: Commit the current state before fixing
9. **When code is edited**: Commit when any test goes from failing to passing
10. **When PR is ready**: Create workflow optimization analysis

## üéØ Project-Specific Guidelines

### PR Creation Workflow

1. Create feature branch in worktree
2. **IMMEDIATELY PUSH BRANCH** - Use `git push -u origin branch-name`
3. **CREATE DRAFT PR IMMEDIATELY** - Use `gh pr create --draft --body-file /docs/CLAUDE_WORKSPACE/pr-template.md`
4. Implement with TDD approach
5. Run tests with coverage
6. Commit with detailed message
7. **AUTOMATICALLY PUSH EVERY COMMIT** - Use `git push`
8. Update PR description with each commit using template: `gh pr edit --body-file /docs/CLAUDE_WORKSPACE/pr-template.md`
9. **AUTO-READY PR** - When all tests pass and branch is fully pushed:
   - Check CI status with `gh pr checks <PR-NUMBER>`
   - If all checks pass, mark ready: `gh pr ready <PR-NUMBER>`
10. **MONITOR CI STATUS** - Check PR status every 30 seconds after push:

- Run `gh pr checks <PR-NUMBER>` to see status
- If any checks fail, investigate with `gh run view <RUN-ID> --log-failed`
- Fix issues and push updates immediately
- Continue monitoring until all checks pass

9. **CLEAN UP AFTER MERGE** - When user mentions PR was merged:
   - Switch to dev branch: `git checkout dev`
   - Pull latest changes: `git pull origin dev`
   - Delete local feature branch: `git branch -d feature/branch-name`
   - Delete remote feature branch: `git push origin --delete feature/branch-name`
   - Archive feature journal: Move from `journal/features/` to `journal/archive/YYYY-MM/`
   - Check if worktree needs cleanup: `git worktree list`
10. **OPTIMIZE WORKFLOW** - When PR is ready for review:
    - Create workflow optimization analysis in `workflow-optimization-strategies/`
    - Review feature journal for repetitive tasks
    - Identify automation opportunities (hooks, scripts, aliases)
    - Document time savings and implementation priority

**IMPORTANT**: If the user mentions pushing changes or asks about a PR, ALWAYS create one using `gh pr create --body-file /docs/CLAUDE_WORKSPACE/pr-template.md`. Don't wait to be explicitly asked.

**CRITICAL**: After pushing or updating a PR, you MUST monitor CI status every 30 seconds until all checks pass. Do not assume CI will pass just because local tests pass.

**AUTOMATIC**: When user mentions a PR was merged, immediately perform branch cleanup without being asked.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Git Operations

- **Never push directly to dev/main** - always use feature branches
- **Check for rebasing needs** - use `git pull --rebase` when branches diverge
- **Avoid duplicate files** - check `git status` before staging
- **Clean up after PR merge** - remove worktrees and delete branches

### Testing

- **Don't skip tests** - even for "simple" documentation changes
- **Check for import errors** - ensure all dependencies are installed
- **Watch for mypy errors** - duplicate files often cause module conflicts
- **Commit after test runs** - maintain complete history

### Documentation

- **Update prompt journal immediately** - don't wait until end of session
- **Include architectural discoveries** - document when reality differs from plan
- **Clarify assumptions** - especially around interfaces (MCP vs CLI)

## üõ†Ô∏è QEMU VM Setup Scripts

### Script Usage Guidelines

- Always create shell scripts for command-line tasks in the QEMU_VM.md plan
- Save scripts to `./qemu_setup_scripts/` directory
- Maintain order of successful scripts in `./qemu_setup_scripts/SUCCESSFUL_SCRIPT_ORDER.md`
- Goal: Create a one-shot setup script from the successful script order
- **OS**: Use Linux Mint 22.1 xia for QEMU images (not Ubuntu)

### Last Used Commands

```bash
# Create qemu_setup_scripts directory
mkdir -p /home/vng/dev/chicken-dinner/qemu_setup_scripts
```

## üìù Commit Message Format

Every commit must follow this template:

```
<type>: <brief description>

- Total: X tests
- Passed: Y tests
- Failed: Z tests

Failed Tests:
- test_name_1: <error message>
- test_name_2: <error message>

Test Changes:
- Added: <list of new test functions/classes added>
- Deleted: <list of test functions/classes removed>
- Modified: <list of test functions/classes changed>

Changes:
- <what was changed and why>
```

### Example Commit

Test Changes:
- Added: test_jwt_expired_token, test_malformed_token, test_missing_auth_header
- Deleted: None
- Modified: test_valid_token (added edge case assertions)

Changes:

- Fixed error status codes for invalid tokens
- Added try-catch for malformed JWT parsing
```

- # Workflow rules
-
- Always use docs/CLAUDE_WORKSPACE/pr-template.md for the PR template.
- Always fill in as much detail as possible with the PR templates
- Always use test driven development.
- All tests must pass for a feature to be considered complete.
- Features with no tests must be explicitly marked by a human with '@skiptest('some reason here')' in the task plan.
- Don't use a TODO list in memory. use the markdown task list to organize work.
- Always update the plan markdown after tests are run.
