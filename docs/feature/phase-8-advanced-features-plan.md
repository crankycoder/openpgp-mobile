# Phase 8: Advanced Features - Task Plan (Revised)

## Overview
Implement advanced features and comprehensive testing for the C binding library, focusing on edge cases, performance optimization, and complete integration testing within the constraints of the current bridge implementation.

## Bridge Limitations
The current bridge does NOT support:
- Multi-recipient encryption (only single public_key field)
- Native combined sign-and-encrypt operations (but we can compose them)
- Native combined decrypt-and-verify operations (but we can compose them)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Composite sign-and-encrypt/decrypt-and-verify operations implemented
- [ ] Comprehensive edge case testing for all existing operations
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established for all operations
- [ ] Integration tests verify all operations work together
- [ ] Memory optimization for large data operations
- [ ] Streaming operations for large files (if feasible)
- [ ] No memory leaks detected by valgrind
- [ ] All tests pass with 100% success rate
- [ ] Documentation complete with performance guidelines

## Task Breakdown

### Task 8.1: Implement Composite Operations
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Time**: 4 hours

#### Subtasks:
1. [ ] Add composite sign-and-encrypt operations:
   - [ ] `openpgp_sign_and_encrypt()` - Sign message then encrypt the signed data
   - [ ] `openpgp_decrypt_and_verify()` - Decrypt then verify the signature
   - [ ] Define SignAndEncryptResult and DecryptAndVerifyResult structs
   - [ ] Handle proper cleanup for intermediate data
   - [ ] Implementation approach:
     ```c
     // Sign-and-encrypt: 
     // 1. Sign the message with private key
     // 2. Encrypt the signed message with recipient's public key
     
     // Decrypt-and-verify:
     // 1. Decrypt with private key to get signed message
     // 2. Verify signature with sender's public key
     ```
2. [ ] Add convenience functions that combine existing operations:
   - [ ] `openpgp_encrypt_and_armor()` - Encrypt then armor encode
   - [ ] `openpgp_dearmor_and_decrypt()` - Dearmor then decrypt
   - [ ] `openpgp_sign_and_armor()` - Sign then armor encode
   - [ ] `openpgp_dearmor_and_verify()` - Dearmor then verify
3. [ ] Add helper functions:
   - [ ] `openpgp_is_encrypted()` - Check if data is encrypted
   - [ ] `openpgp_is_signed()` - Check if data is signed
   - [ ] `openpgp_is_armored()` - Check if data is armored
   - [ ] `openpgp_validate_key_format()` - Validate key format
4. [ ] Add utility functions:
   - [ ] `openpgp_generate_secure_passphrase()` - Generate random passphrase

## Implementation Order
1. Task 8.1: Composite operations (high-value feature)
2. Task 8.2: Edge case testing (foundation for robustness)
3. Task 8.3: Integration tests (verify composite operations work)
4. Task 8.4: Performance optimization (establish baselines)
5. Task 8.5: Large data support (push the boundaries)
6. Task 8.6: Documentation (capture all knowledge)

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: FlatBuffer 4KB limit severely constrains operations
  - **Mitigation**: Document limits clearly, implement chunking where possible
  
- **Risk**: Performance may degrade with security improvements
  - **Mitigation**: Balance security and performance, document tradeoffs
  
- **Risk**: Edge cases may reveal bridge limitations
  - **Mitigation**: Test early, document limitations, provide workarounds

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All composite operations implemented and tested
- [ ] All edge cases handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance benchmarks established and documented
- [ ] Integration tests pass consistently
- [ ] Convenience functions simplify common tasks
- [ ] Size limits documented and enforced
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation and examples
- [ ] Zero memory leaks in all scenarios
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] PR created and CI passes

## Notes
- Focus on making the existing API rock-solid rather than adding unsupported features
- Emphasize reliability, performance, and usability
- Document all limitations clearly to set proper expectations
- Consider future bridge enhancements but don't depend on them
