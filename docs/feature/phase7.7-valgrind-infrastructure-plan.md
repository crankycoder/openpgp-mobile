# Phase 7.7: Comprehensive Valgrind Error Detection and Fixes - Task Plan

## Overview

This phase systematically detects, diagnoses, and fixes ALL valgrind-detectable errors across the entire C codebase. This extends the work from Phase 7.6 to ensure zero memory issues in production.

## Root Cause Patterns from Phase 7.6

Based on Phase 7.6 discoveries, we must check for:

1. **Memory Leaks in Error Paths**: Functions returning `openpgp_result_t` may allocate error messages that callers forget to free
2. **Buffer Overruns**: `flatcc_builder_get_direct_buffer()` returns NULL for large buffers but code doesn't check
3. **Unchecked Return Values**: Library functions that can fail silently (especially buffer/memory operations)
4. **Test Isolation Issues**: Global state and memory tracking inconsistencies between tests
5. **Silent Size Limit Failures**: Operations failing without clear errors when data exceeds library limits

## Task Breakdown

### Task #1: Create Valgrind Test Infrastructure

- Status: not started
- Description: Set up automated valgrind testing with proper suppressions and reporting to enable systematic memory error detection across all test files
- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Script `/c/test/valgrind-runner.sh` exists and can run any test file under valgrind
  - Script accepts test executable name as parameter
  - Script generates clear output showing memory leaks, errors, and their locations
  - Suppressions file `/c/test/valgrind.supp` exists with suppressions for known false positives
  - Script `/c/test/memory-check-all.sh` exists to run all tests and aggregate results
  - Exit codes: 0 for clean run, 1 for memory errors
  - Scripts are executable and have proper shebang lines
- Assumptions:
  - Valgrind is installed on the development system
  - Test executables are in the standard output directory
- Dependencies:
  - None - this is the foundation task
- Reference files:
  - `/c/test/` - Directory where scripts will be created
  - `/c/test/valgrind_test.sh` - Existing valgrind test script from Phase 7.6
- Examples for implementing:
  - Good example: Script with clear output formatting, proper error checking, and helpful usage messages
  - Bad example: Script that silently fails or produces unclear output

### Task #2: Individual Test File Valgrind Analysis

- Acceptance Criteria:
  - Run valgrind on all 14 test files individually
  - Create report file `/c/test/valgrind-report.md` with findings

## Implementation Order

1. **Infrastructure First** (Task 1): Set up valgrind automation
2. **Discovery** (Task 2): Run all tests to find issues  
3. **Common Patterns** (Tasks 3-5): Fix widespread issues
4. **Isolation** (Task 6): Ensure test reliability
5. **Prevention** (Tasks 7-8): Add validation and regression tests
6. **Documentation** (Task 9): Capture knowledge

## Success Criteria

- Zero valgrind errors in all test files
- Zero memory leaks in all operations
- No buffer overruns or invalid memory access
- Clear error messages for all failure cases
- Automated checks preventing regressions
- Comprehensive documentation of patterns and fixes

## Test-Driven Development Approach

For each fix:
1. Write a test that reproduces the memory issue
2. Verify the test fails with valgrind errors
3. Implement the fix
4. Verify the test passes with no valgrind errors
5. Ensure all existing tests still pass
